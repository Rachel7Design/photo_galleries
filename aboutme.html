    <div class="aboutrachel">
    <p > Rachel’s journey into technology was sparked by a passion for storytelling and understanding complex human experiences—interests that now drive her work in natural language processing and human-computer interaction. What began behind a camera lens has evolved into a focus on building intelligent systems that interpret, respond to, and support human needs in meaningful ways. <br><br>

She is currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Human-Computer Interaction at the University of Michigan, where she explores the intersection of language, AI, and design. Her work involves applying NLP techniques to enhance user experiences, analyze qualitative and quantitative data at scale, and develop tools that support social impact initiatives. <br><br>

Rachel thrives in interdisciplinary environments that blend technical rigor with creativity. With strong interests in sustainability, ethics, and inclusive design, she brings a research-driven yet empathetic approach to every project. <br><br>

With deep roots in Costa Rica, Rachel draws inspiration from nature, cultural diversity, and systems thinking. Whether collaborating with cross-functional teams or developing machine learning models, she is driven by curiosity, adaptability, and a commitment to designing technology that truly serves people. </p>
