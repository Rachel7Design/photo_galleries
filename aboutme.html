    <div class="aboutrachel">
    <p > Rachel’s journey began behind a camera lens, where she developed a passion for storytelling and understanding complex human experiences. What started as a creative outlet—after receiving her first camera from her mom—evolved into a broader commitment to solving meaningful challenges through thoughtful, people-centered work. <br><br>

She is currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Human-Computer Interaction at the University of Michigan, where she focuses on creating scalable solutions that address real-world problems. Her work is shaped by a strong interest in social impact, sustainability, and interdisciplinary collaboration, and she thrives in environments that combine analytical thinking with creative exploration.
<br><br>
With deep ties to Costa Rica, Rachel draws inspiration from nature and cultural diversity. Whether working with stakeholders, conducting research, or shaping strategy, she brings curiosity, adaptability, and a genuine commitment to creating lasting, human-centered impact.</p>
